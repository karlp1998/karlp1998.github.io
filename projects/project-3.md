For this project, I had to create a program that calculated the total amount of money someone has made over a year, taking into account state and/or federal taxes. Although this was a pretty simple program, writing in a new language was a bit hard at first, but overall we can benefit from learning new languages to develop our skills in Computer Science/Programming.
