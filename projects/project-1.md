I'm hoping that this shows how committed I can be when trying to get better at something I enjoy as I've been playing this game consistently for 8 years and I can consistently rank in the top 1% of players in the North American region, which unfortunately still isn't even the top 600 players, but I am still motivated and striving to reach. Luckily for those of us who enjoy playing competitive video-games, we are in a generation in which eSports as a whole has blown up worldwide and become a billion-dollar industry which allows organizations to run university-based tournaments for students such as CSL (cstarleague) that is similar to those of traditional sports univeristy org's such as NCAA. This gives students opportunities to play qualified games in an organized team environment and and also allows us to play for cash prizes and/or scholarship money.
