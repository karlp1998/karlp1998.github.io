## What you put in is what you get out

I've had to learn throughout my university life that the amount of time and effort you put into something is what you'll get out in return. The amount of time and effort you put into whatever you do will ultimately define your success in that field of work, whether it be your relationships, your education, or your career, there really isn't an easy way towards success and no matter how tempting any shortcuts may seem to be at the time, it won't seem to be worth it in the long run. Another important aspect I've learned is about keeping at your own pace, as long as you don't fall too far behind is what worked best for me, and this probably wouldn't work for everyone, but I just feel going at your own pace as long as it's consistent can help keep your life balanced.

## Relating back to Programming

Relating this back to coding is pretty simple, learning a programming language is tedious work and may not seem to make sense at first. It took me a while to understand arrays and for loops but just doing things over and over and on a consistent basis helped a lot to help further my knowledge in coding. I've learned that balancing time in my life to accomodate for time in studying programming has greatly helped me to learn new concepts and ideas that seemed like foreign language to me at first, so in the end, I feel like the time I put into learning different programming languages benefitted me greatly

## Conclusion

Time and effort are important aspects of not just learning, but in life overall, I've had many occasions where I'd skip on doing chores and homework only to have them pile up and just come crashing down on me all on the last minute, also known as procrastination. In the end it's the time and effort that will count towards whatever you set your mind to do and whatever you put into that will result in what you will get out of it as well.
