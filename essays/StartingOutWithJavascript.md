Starting out with Javascript:
I was honestly pretty excited to be learning a new language, as it gives us another opportunity to relearn the base essentials of coding in general. Although there are a lot of new key vocabulary to learn for this language, I found it a lot more fun than when first learning java in ICS 111, and I’d imagine it’s because we already have the basics of coding down such as knowing how arrays work, knowing how to set up for loops and the such, and when working on freecodecamp, it really helped a lot to better understand how to use this language efficiently.

Overall Thoughts:
My overall thoughts after getting to know the basics of this language is that I agree with what Professor Johnson has said about it so far compared to Java and C++, I really like the unique feature that allows us to ignore specific types and instead lets us use keywords such as ‘var,’ ‘let,’ and ‘const.’ I feel it makes the language overall easier as it is less likely to have any type errors. I also liked how the general basics of coding was similar to that of C++ and Java specifically when it comes to arrays and loops and functions, I’d imagine that it is because these are just the basics of programming overall.

Goals:
My goal for this course and javascript in all is to be efficient at this language, as I’ve already enjoyed using this language a lot more than compared to Java and C++. With getting to know more about this language, I hope I can be efficient enough to start some personal mini projects in making some mini-games to help develop my overall skills for javascript. Some big project in mind was to be able to make an RPG or graphic novel game and even develop some AI in a video game, and with further developing my knowledge in programming, I hope to make it with whatever language I deem the most efficient for these tasks.
